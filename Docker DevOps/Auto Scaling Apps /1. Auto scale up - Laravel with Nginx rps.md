To dynamically scale the number of Laravel replicas based on the request rate (RPS) handled by the Nginx service, you can use Docker Swarm's **autoscaling** capabilities in combination with monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **cAdvisor**, and **Grafana**. Alternatively, you can use a custom script to monitor the RPS and adjust the number of replicas accordingly.

Here’s how you can achieve this:

---

### **1. Monitoring Nginx RPS**

To autoscale Laravel replicas based on Nginx RPS, you need to monitor the request rate handled by Nginx. There are several ways to do this:

#### **Option 1: Use Prometheus + cAdvisor + Grafana**
- **Prometheus**: A time-series database for collecting metrics.
- **cAdvisor**: A tool that collects container-level metrics (CPU, memory, network, etc.) from Docker containers.
- **Grafana**: A visualization tool to display metrics collected by Prometheus.

##### Steps:
1. **Deploy Prometheus and cAdvisor**:
   - Deploy `cAdvisor` as a sidecar container to collect metrics from your Nginx container.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from `cAdvisor`.

2. **Collect Nginx Metrics**:
   - You can expose Nginx metrics using the **Nginx status module** or **Nginx VTS (Virtual Host Traffic Status)** module.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics.

3. **Visualize Metrics in Grafana**:
   - Create a dashboard in Grafana to visualize the RPS handled by Nginx.

4. **Set Up Alerts**:
   - Configure alerts in Prometheus or Grafana based on the RPS threshold (e.g., scale up if RPS > X, scale down if RPS < Y).

---

#### **Option 2: Custom Script to Monitor Nginx Logs**
If you prefer a simpler approach without setting up Prometheus, you can write a custom script to parse Nginx logs and calculate the RPS.

##### Example Python Script:
```python
import time
import subprocess

def get_nginx_rps():
    # Get the last minute of Nginx access logs
    log_file = "/var/log/nginx/access.log"
    cmd = f"grep 'HTTP/1.1' {log_file} | awk '{{print $4}}' | cut -d: -f2,3 | sort | uniq -c"
    result = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Parse the result to calculate RPS
    lines = result.strip().split("\n")
    total_requests = sum(int(line.split()[0]) for line in lines)
    rps = total_requests / 60  # Assuming logs are for the last minute
    return rps

while True:
    rps = get_nginx_rps()
    print(f"Current RPS: {rps}")
    
    # Scale Laravel replicas based on RPS
    if rps > 50:  # Scale up if RPS is high
        subprocess.run("docker service scale laravel_app=15", shell=True)
    elif rps < 10:  # Scale down if RPS is low
        subprocess.run("docker service scale laravel_app=5", shell=True)
    
    time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute
```

### **2. Autoscaling Laravel Replicas**

Once you have the RPS data, you can use it to dynamically scale the number of Laravel replicas.

#### **Using Docker Swarm CLI**
You can use the `docker service scale` command to increase or decrease the number of replicas based on the RPS.

Example:
```bash
docker service scale laravel_app=10  # Scale to 10 replicas
docker service scale laravel_app=5   # Scale down to 5 replicas
```

#### **Automating Scaling with a Script**
You can automate the scaling process using a script that monitors the RPS and adjusts the number of replicas accordingly.

---

### **3. Advanced: Use Docker Swarm Mode with External Autoscaler**

Docker Swarm itself does not have built-in autoscaling based on metrics like RPS. However, you can integrate external tools like **Traefik**, **Kubernetes**, or **custom scripts** to achieve this.

#### **Option 1: Use Traefik with Prometheus**
- **Traefik** is a reverse proxy that integrates well with Docker Swarm.
- You can configure Traefik to expose metrics to Prometheus and use those metrics to trigger scaling actions.

#### **Option 2: Use Kubernetes Instead of Docker Swarm**
If you need more advanced autoscaling features, consider migrating to Kubernetes. Kubernetes has built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) that can scale deployments based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics like RPS.

### **4. Example Workflow**

Here’s a complete workflow for autoscaling Laravel replicas based on Nginx RPS:

1. **Monitor Nginx RPS**:
   - Use Prometheus + cAdvisor or a custom script to monitor the RPS handled by Nginx.

2. **Define Scaling Rules**:
   - If RPS > 50, scale up Laravel replicas to 15.
   - If RPS < 10, scale down Laravel replicas to 5.

3. **Automate Scaling**:
   - Write a script (e.g., in Python or Bash) that checks the RPS every minute and adjusts the number of Laravel replicas using `docker service scale`.

4. **Optional: Add Alerts**:
   - Use Prometheus or Grafana to set up alerts when RPS exceeds certain thresholds.

---

### **5. Example Script for Autoscaling**

Here’s an example Bash script that scales Laravel replicas based on RPS:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to get current RPS from Nginx logs
get_rps() {
    log_file="/var/log/nginx/access.log"
    # Calculate requests per second for the last minute
    rps=$(grep 'HTTP/1.1' "$log_file" | awk '{print $4}' | cut -d: -f2,3 | sort | uniq -c | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum/60}')
    echo "$rps"
}

# Main loop
while true; do
    rps=$(get_rps)
    echo "Current RPS: $rps"

    if (( $(echo "$rps > 50" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "Scaling up Laravel replicas..."
        docker service scale laravel_app=15
    elif (( $(echo "$rps < 10" | bc -l) )); then
        echo "Scaling down Laravel replicas..."
        docker service scale laravel_app=5
    fi

    sleep 60  # Check every minute
done
```

### **6. Conclusion**

By combining monitoring tools like Prometheus and cAdvisor with Docker Swarm's `docker service scale` command, you can dynamically scale Laravel replicas based on Nginx RPS. Alternatively, you can use a custom script to monitor Nginx logs and adjust the number of replicas automatically.

This approach ensures that your application scales efficiently based on traffic demand, optimizing resource usage and performance.
