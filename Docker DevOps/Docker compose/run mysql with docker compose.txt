To check the status of your active Docker containers, you can use the following commands:

### 1. **Check Active Containers**
   This command lists all currently running containers:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   This will show output like the following:

   ```
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES
   1a2b3c4d5e6f   mysql:latest            "docker-entrypoint.s…"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp mysql-container
   7g8h9i0j1k2l   phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp     phpmyadmin-container
   ```

   - **CONTAINER ID**: The unique identifier for each container.
   - **IMAGE**: The image from which the container was started.
   - **COMMAND**: The command the container is running.
   - **CREATED**: When the container was created.
   - **STATUS**: The current state of the container (`Up` means it's running).
   - **PORTS**: The ports that are being exposed and mapped.
   - **NAMES**: The name of the container.

### 2. **Check All Containers (Including Stopped Containers)**
   If you want to see all containers, including those that are stopped:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

   This will list both running and stopped containers.

### 3. **Check Container Logs**
   You can also check the logs of a specific container by using:

   ```bash
   docker logs <container_name_or_id>
   ```

   For example, to check the logs of your MySQL container:

   ```bash
   docker logs mysql-container
   ```
