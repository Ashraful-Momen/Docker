Here's a brief note on Docker image management commands:

### Listing Docker Images
To list all Docker images on your system:
```bash
docker images
```
or
```bash
docker image ls
```

### Removing Docker Images
To remove a specific image by its ID or repository tag:
```bash
docker rmi <image_id_or_tag>
```
To remove all unused images (dangling images):
```bash
docker image prune
```
To remove all unused images, not just dangling ones:
```bash
docker image prune -a
```

### Tagging Docker Images
To tag an image:
```bash
docker tag <source_image> <target_image>
```
Example:
```bash
docker tag my_image:latest my_image:1.0
```

### Building Docker Images
To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> <path_to_dockerfile>
```
Example:
```bash
docker build -t my_image:latest .
```

### Pushing Docker Images to a Registry
To push an image to a Docker registry (like Docker Hub):
```bash
docker push <image_name>:<tag>
```
Example:
```bash
docker push my_image:latest
```

### Pulling Docker Images from a Registry
To pull an image from a Docker registry:
```bash
docker pull <image_name>:<tag>
```
Example:
```bash
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

### Removing Dangling Images
Dangling images are layers that are not tagged and not referenced by any container:
```bash
docker image prune
```

### Removing Specific Image
To forcefully remove an image, even if it's used by stopped containers:
```bash
docker rmi -f <image_id_or_tag>
```

### Inspecting Docker Images
To view detailed information about a Docker image:
```bash
docker inspect <image_id_or_tag>
```

These commands will help you effectively manage Docker images in your development and production environments.
